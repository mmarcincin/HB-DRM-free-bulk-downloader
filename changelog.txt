HB DRM-free bulk downloader 0.2
----------------------
- added support for folder/file paths with the 260+ character length
- added support for global and link preferred label/suffix/extension

To specify your preferred label/extension/format for link only, use:
- https://www.humblebundle.com/downloads?key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX#pdf
- https://www.humblebundle.com/downloads?key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX#pdf,epub,mp3
- link preferred label will always override global one

for global preferred label use:
- #pdf
- #pdf,epub,mp3
- https://www.humblebundle.com/downloads?key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
- https://www.humblebundle.com/downloads?key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
- #none (default, this will return to downloading all versions)
- if some book/game/audio doesn't have preferred label, it'll download first label (unless overridden by %strict)

platform global switches:
- @default (needed only when you want to reset it back, for exmaple from mac back to default for next set of links)
- @windows (usually selected by default; if you really want to reset it use @default instead)
- @mac
- @linux
- all of them works but it has to be the exact wording (e.g. @android)

other global switches:
- %strict (this will download only your preferred label)
- %normal (default, this will return to downloading at least 1 label)
- %pref (default, download first found preferred label in list and skip others)
- %all (download all preferred labels)

They can be used together in one line:
- %strict,pref (this would download only 1 specified label and skip others, even those without the pref label)

only # and % switches supports multiple parameters

----------------------
HB books bulk downloader 0.1
----------------------
It's a powershell script which allows you to download books from humble bundle pages (https://www.humblebundle.com/downloads?key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX) in bulk.
It works natively for Windows 8+, Windows 7 required downloading the Powershell 3+, link below.
It uses Internet Explorer instance to retrieve the links so all you need to do is login to humble bundle through the internet explorer and that's it.

Right now the script puts bundle into its own folder, each book into the subfolder and all versions inside. The download is sequential for now.
I'll add some options later, like download only some versions (pdf, epub, etc..) and maybe different folder sorting by book version instead of book name (for example, all pdf in one folder).

To install newer Powershell for Windows 7, visit this link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-windows-powershell?view=powershell-6

Powershell ExecutionPolicy change
----------------------
start RUN.bat to launch the script
for editing the script itself open HB-books_download.ps1 in notepad (or notepad++,etc...)

If the window closes fast after starting RUN.bat, follow these steps: 
1. Go to any folder (file explorer) and choose file > open windows powershell > 
   > open windows powershell as administrator.
2. In the Windows PowerShell window type: get-ExecutionPolicy.
3. If you are geting the 'Restricted' text, type: set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned,
   then just confirm with y for yes.
4. After that the RUN.bat should work as intented.

If you'd like to create a shortcut for the script, you just need to make shortcut of RUN.bat file.

Possible Errors - unremovable folder with leading/trailing space
----------------------
If my script created folder with space (" ") in name and you can't remove it now, you could try this to fix it:
quote by JustSolvedIt from https://superuser.com/questions/565334/rename-delete-windows-x64-folder-with-leading-and-trailing-space/911994#911994
> I just had a similar problem with folder "Monuments - Discography " created in linux. Windows Vista and Windows 7 couldn't recognize this folder as a valid data and when I tried to rename or remove it I got Info message saying that folder does not exist etc. The solution was to explore a dir with 7zip file manager and rename the folder by removing a white space from the end. Simple. Now I can enjoy the music once again :D
